This repositiry contains Sagemaker componets and services that perform the following tasks:

• Ingest, register, and explore datasets

• Detect statistical bias in a dataset

• Automatically train and select models with AutoML

• Create machine learning features from raw data

• Save and manage features in a feature store

• Train and evaluate models using built-in algorithms and custom BERT models

• Debug, profile, and compare models to improve performance

• Build and run a complete ML pipeline end-to-end

• Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning

• Deploy and monitor models

• Perform data labeling at scale

• Build a human-in-the-loop pipeline to improve model performance

• Reduce cost and improve performance of data products
